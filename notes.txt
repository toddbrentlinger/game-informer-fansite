App Structure:
- staff
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- game
    - DetailView
    - ListViewp
- replay
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- superreplay
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- testchamber
    - DetailView
    - ListView

- ISSUE: Some models like Game, Staff, etc. are shared between each app. 
Should I just create them in one and import in the others 
OR create a base app to hold any shared models and import them into other apps?
Maybe all apps with shared models should be in combined into single app OR create 
separate app for each of those shared models since they each need their own DetailView 
and ListView also.
