Reset PostgreSQL database:

- Delete files in <app-title>/migrations/ except those that start with "__init__"

- Open SQL Shell (psql) and login to database using user, password, and port.
    DROP DATABASE dbname;
    CREATE DATABASE dbname;

- Re-create migrations.
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

- Superuser was removed. Must add it again.
    python manage.py createsuperuser

- How to account for choices not having an appropriate choice?
Create separate model for the choices where a new one can be added.

- Should Episode.id be 'editable'?

- YouTubeVideo.thumbnails should use a default thumbnail referenced by the pk value. Perhaps it should be 
the first thumbnail instanced added to the database with pk=0

- Runtime AND Airdate in Episode could instead be used in YouTubeVideo.

X Replace PositiveIntegerField with PositiveSmallIntegerField
Small Integer limit is 32767

- Could I use ImageField built-in model for Thumbnail?

- Host/Featuring: For new Featuring entries, check that each Staff is NOT already listed in Host position

App Structure:
- staff
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- game
    - DetailView
    - ListViewp
- replay
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- superreplay
    - DetailView
    - ListView
- testchamber
    - DetailView
    - ListView

- ISSUE: Some models like Game, Staff, etc. are shared between each app. 
Should I just create them in one and import in the others 
OR create a base app to hold any shared models and import them into other apps?
Maybe all apps with shared models should be in combined into single app OR create 
separate app for each of those shared models since they each need their own DetailView 
and ListView also.
