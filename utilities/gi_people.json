            "Dan Ryckert Is a God and\u00a0was raised in a swamp, and was an Associate Editor at Game Informer. Dan, Andrew Reiner, and Tim Turi were the founding members of Replay. Dan was also the editor of the replay videos before Ben Hanson was hired. Dan created the logo and the short beginning video for the show, which stayed that way until Season 2 began with the GoldenEye 007 Replay. Being also the creator of Super Replay, Dan chose his favorite game to start the new series; an idea that isn't prominent in the series today. He left Game Informer at the end of May 2014. Reiner claims he was traded to Giant Bomb for a non-working Sega Genesis controller.",
            "On Replay, Dan Ryckert often engages in battle with his nemesis Joe Juba (AKA: That Jerk Joe Juba). He is well known for his sound of panic and/or fear, \"BRAAAAAAAAP!\". When outraged at a co-worker, he shouts \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" at the top of his lungs, such as when Phil Kollar skipped the opening cutscene of Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, or Reiner wasting a cloud in Super Mario Bros. 3 Super Replay.",
            "Dan is often chastised and belittled by his co-workers on Replay due to his short memory, inability to pay attention to boring games, and general incopetence. Despite this, Dan is a fan favorite, as he is the most involved in the FaceBook group, I Watched the Entire Overblood Super Replay. During intense moments in video games (such as the Mike Tyson's Punch Out!! and Super Mario Bros. 2 episode), Dan will shout and start to panic, much to Joe Juba's delight.",
            "A recurring gag with Dan is that he was raised in a swamp, a joke started by Reiner in the StarCraft 64 episode. He has since proven this wrong, but his co-workers also joke that Kansas was on the Confederate side during the Civil War, another fact he proved incorrect.",
            "Dan has appeared in every Super Replay, with five of them he was at the controls.\u00a0 Dan has even made thirteen videos of him and his dad playing games; the latter doing a poor job of it.",
            "Dan has published two books, Air Force Gator in 2012 and Air Force Gator 2: Scales of Justice in 2013.",
            "Dan's last appearance on Replay as a Game Informer staff member was on the Mario Party 2 episode, dated May 31, 2014."

Dan has expressed interest in writing more sequels if there is a demand for them.",

Going into the second attempt, other participants like Tim Turi and Phil Kollar believed that this would continue, and Dan would be the first to quit. Ironically, Tim was the first to drop out, and Dan was tied with Jeff Cork for the longest marathon. He got the record for longest time spent playing a Mario game, playing for 50 hours.

            "Kimberley \"Kstar\"\u00a0Wallace is the Features Editor for GameInformer magazine.",
            "Kim can thank her gaming addiction to her two older brothers. When they'd go to school, she'd sneak in their room and set up the NES. An unfortunate side effect to her sneaky antics was that she learned to play holding the controller upside down. The impact was so great that she wasn't able to rectify her mistake until the PlayStation era. Since then, Kimberley's discovered a special passion for RPGs, especially through playing them with her late grandfather; some of her fondest memories are from playing Secret of Mana with him. A University of Iowa graduate with degrees in Journalism and English, Kimberley knew that combining games and writing was the only way to go in her career. ",
            "Kimberley was previously a freelance writer and her work has been featured in Official Xbox Magazine, GamesRadar, PlayStation: The Official Magazine, and Joystiq. She revels in finding unique stories that deserve focus. She also strives to showcase the positive influence of games in lives, as she knows their power well, having helped in her pain management for a chronic illness. ",
            "Besides her life revolving around cutscenes, she's also an avid hockey fan. Sorry, Minnesota - the Blackhawks will forever own her heart.",
            "Kim's first Replay apperance was as a guest on the Double Dragon II Replay. She co-hosted the Trapt Super Replay with Andrew Reiner, Dan Ryckert, and Jeff Cork."

He joined Game Informer in 2017, but worked in healthcare before that and was fortunate enough to freelance for Paste, Playboy, Five Out of Ten, among others. He has made Bayonetta director Hideki Kamiya sign every game Kamiya has made and is coming close to a complete collection. During the rare times he is not writing or playing games, he is wishing Netflix had a random button or crashing his scooter. Imran Khan was laid off from Gameinformer on 8/20/2019."

Tim was the most called upon stick player, mainly because he had a more patience than other editors. Tim was also the co-host of The Game Informer Show, along with Ben Hanson , after the departure of former host Matt Helgeson .",
            "Tim was known for his skill in games, particularly with Capcom games such as Mega Man. He also was berated and ridiculed for his expansive knowledge of the Sonic the Hedgehog series by other staff members, as he was the only one who even noticed the character's redesign with Sonic Adventure. Tim is also a fan of heavy metal music, as evidenced by his discussion of Pantera during an episode of the Game Informer Show and his wearing a Kalmah shirt during an episode of Super Replay.",
